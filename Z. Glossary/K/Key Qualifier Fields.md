Key qualifier fields are schema fields that are automatically added to DLOs and DMOs by Data Cloud. Key qualifier fields contain key qualifiers. Key qualifiers are values configured for key qualifier fields to identify the data source. Create and configure key qualifiers for each DLO field that contains either a primary key or a foreign key.
