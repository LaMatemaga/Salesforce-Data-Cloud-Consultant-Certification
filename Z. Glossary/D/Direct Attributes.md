Attributes that have only one value for a record in the Segment On object. For example, if Individual DMO is selected as Segment On, then Individual.First Name or Individual.Gender attributes are listed as direct attributes. Additionally, all attributes from other DMOs that are related to Individual with a relationship cardinality of 1:1 are direct attributes.Â
