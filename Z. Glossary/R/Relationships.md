A connection between two [[object]]s or sets of data. Relationships include:
- **One-to-one (1:1):** A link between the information in two tables, where each record in each table only appears one time. For example, a one-to-one relationship between employees and the cars they drive. See [[Direct Attributes]].
- **One-to-many (1:N):** A relationship between records in which one record in a table can be associated with one or more records in another table. For example, each customer can have many sales orders. See [[Related Attributes]].
