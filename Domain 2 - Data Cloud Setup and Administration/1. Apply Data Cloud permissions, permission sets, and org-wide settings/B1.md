# Apply Data Cloud permissions, permission sets, and org-wide settings
## Describe user roles and permissions

Now that you have your bearings, let’s look at another key aspect of your role as admin: user management. User permissions—determined by permission sets—specify the tasks users can perform and the features they can access. After you create each user, you need to assign a permission set to the user.

>[!Warning]
To manage and assign users in Setup and access Data Cloud Setup, **you must be a Data Cloud Admin and have a Salesforce administrator profile or permission set that grants access to Salesforce Setup**. If you have access to Salesforce Setup, you can set up the application, and access Salesforce Sales and Service clouds and other integrated Salesforce systems.

Here are the standard permission set options in Data Cloud.

### ✅ **Data Cloud**
| **Permission Set** | **Description** |
| ---- | ---- |
| **Data Cloud Admin** | Users with this permission set can access all functionality within Data Cloud, including mapping data to the data model and creating data streams, identity resolution rulesets, and calculated insights. |
| **Data Cloud User** | Users with this permission set can view Data Cloud features. |
### ✅ **Data Cloud for Marketing**

| **Permission Set** | **Description** |
| ---- | ---- |
| **Data Cloud for Marketing Admin** | Users with this permission set can manage day-to-day configuration needs, support, maintenance, and improvement and perform regular internal system audits. |
| **Data Cloud Marketing Manager** | Users with this permission set can manage an overall segmentation strategy, including creating activation targets and activations. |
| **Data Cloud Marketing Specialist** | Users with this permission set can create segments. |
| **Data Cloud Data Aware Specialist** | Users with this permission set can map data to the data model and create data streams, identity resolution rulesets, and calculated insights. |
You should work closely with these individuals to make sure that your Data Platform account meets the needs of all your users.

>[!Warning]
>If you have a small team, one person can fulfill multiple roles and be assigned multiple permission sets.
