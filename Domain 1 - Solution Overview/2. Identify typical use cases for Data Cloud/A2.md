|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Use Case**|**Explanation**|**Benefit to NTO**|
|**Data unification**|Unify CRM, marketing, commerce, and service data to extend your marketing abilities.|Marketing Cloud, Sales Cloud, and Service Cloud data is imported into Data Cloud. NTO also imports its analytics data, ecommerce data, as well as its CEO’s spreadsheet data.|
|**Customer identity resolution**|Merge customer information from various systems to create a single ID, a single record for a customer. See [[Identity Resolution]]|For NTO, creating a unified customer ID and record is the first step to creating a cohesive and consistent user experience for its customers. NTO’s executives are pleased to see that the merge process revealed duplicate contacts that they can remove for cost savings. See [[Reconciliation Rules]].|
|**Audience segmentation**|Build quick [[audience]] [[segment]]s for marketing campaigns.|NTO marketing manager, Isabelle, is excited about how easy it is for her team to create complex [[segment]]s that can be used across channels. Her team also loves seeing an immediate [[audience]] count so they can decide if they need to narrow their [[audience]] even further for more personalized [[audience]] [[segment]]s.|
|**Delivery management**|Control cross-channel spending by streamlining campaigns.|Isabelle can streamline her customer engagement communications and maintain low costs by targeting customers efficiently in their preferred channel.|
|**Audience suppression**|Create a suppression [[audience]] for marketing and advertising campaigns based on business use cases.|Isabelle is collaborating with the Customer Support team to suppress customers with open support tickets from receiving marketing communications. Jason immediately notices this improves customer satisfaction scores.|
|**Consent management**|Deliver communications based on channel-specific consent and customer preference. See [[Consent Management]].|Since Isabelle is tracking and following a customer’s communication preferences, she not only builds their trust, she also ensures NTO is maintaining privacy compliance.|
|**Analyze metrics**|Visualize and understand customer engagement and long-term retention.|The CEO is thrilled as he finally has an enterprise look at metrics across NTO departments, from marketing to sales to ecommerce data.|
